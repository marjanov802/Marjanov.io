            <h2>About<span>Me</span></h2>
            <p>Currently a <span>Software Engineering</span> undergraduate, class of 2025, and a <span>tennis professional</span> player and coach, I have gained diverse experiences and skills from various aspects of life. With a strong foundation in programming and the ability to quickly learn new languages, I absorb information rapidly. My experience working with people of all ages, cultures, and backgrounds has equipped me to seamlessly integrate into any team, whether in work or social settings, as demonstrated through my involvement in sporting competitions and <span>collaborative projects</span> on robotics and software using <span>Git</span> and <span>remote repositories</span>.<br>
            Beyond my interests in technology and tennis, art—particularly pencil illustrations—has significantly influenced my creativity and thought process since an early age. <span>This passion is reflected in the media on this page, all of which I created myself</span>.</p>
